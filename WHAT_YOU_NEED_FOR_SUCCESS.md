### **2. Test Your APIs** (30 minutes)
**Status**: ⚠️ Ready to test after database setup

**What to do**:
```bash
# Start your server
npm run dev

# Test lesson completion (should work after schema)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lessons/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"test_user","lesson_id":"neural_networks_101","score":85,"satisfaction_rating":4,"engagement_score":8}'

# Test topic generation
curl http://localhost:3000/api/ai/topics?query=machine%20learning

# Test research AI
curl http://localhost:3000/api/intelligence
```

### **3. Basic Frontend Interface** (2-3 days)
